# Smartx PlatformÂ Infrastructure

### Advanced Web Infrastructure Design
#### User Request Workflow
1. **Initiation**: A user initiates a request to access the website `www.foobar.com` .
2. **DNS Resolution**: The domain `foobar.com`  is configured with DNS records (e.g., `A`  or `CNAME` ) pointing to the HAProxy load balancer's public IP address.
#### Infrastructure Overview
The system is distributed across multiple servers to enhance scalability, availability, and fault tolerance:

1. **Load Balancer**: HAProxy handles traffic distribution across application servers. It improves performance and eliminates single points of failure.
2. **Firewall**: A firewall protects each server, allowing only essential traffic on specified ports (e.g., TCP 80, 443).
3. **Monitoring**: Monitoring tools track server health, performance, and traffic analytics.
4. **DNS**: DNS directs user requests to the load balancer's IP address.
#### Server Roles
1. **Application Servers**:
    - **Web Server (Nginx)**:
        - Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests.
        - Serves static files and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
        - Listens on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
    - **Application Framework**:
        - Hosts the backend logic (e.g., Django, Flask).
        - Processes API requests and communicates with the database.
        - Listens on internal ports (e.g., 8000).
2. **Database Server**:
    - MySQL stores application data, ensuring ACID compliance.
    - Access is restricted to specific IPs or internal communication only (listens on port 3306).
3. **Load Balancer**:
    - HAProxy distributes incoming traffic across multiple application servers.
    - Provides high availability by redirecting traffic from failed servers.
#### Network Flow
1. **User Interaction**:
    - A user types `www.foobar.com`  in their browser.
    - The browser sends a DNS query to resolve the domain.
2. **Load Balancing**:
    - The resolved IP address directs the request to the HAProxy load balancer.
    - HAProxy forwards the request to an available application server.
3. **Request Processing**:
    - Nginx on the application server receives the request.
    - Static files are served directly; dynamic requests are passed to the backend framework.
    - The backend interacts with the MySQL database if required.
4. **Response Delivery**:
    - The application server returns the response to Nginx.
    - Nginx forwards the response to HAProxy, which sends it back to the user.
#### Key Components
1. **Domain Name**:
    - Human-readable address (e.g., `www.foobar.com` ) mapped to the load balancer's IP.
    - Configured with `A` , `CNAME` , and `TXT`  records.
2. **HAProxy (Load Balancer)**:
    - Balances traffic across multiple servers.
    - Provides SSL termination if configured.
3. **Firewall**:
    - Configured to block all incoming traffic except necessary ports (TCP 80, 443).
4. **Nginx (Web Server)**:
    - Manages HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
    - Handles SSL certificates and static file delivery.
5. **Application Framework**:
    - Processes business logic and dynamic requests.
    - Examples include Django (Python) or Flask (Python).
6. **Database (MySQL)**:
    - Manages persistent data storage.
    - Accessible only via private networking or authorized IPs.
#### Advantages of the Redesigned Infrastructure
1. **Scalability**:
    - Load balancer supports horizontal scaling by adding more servers.
    - Improved performance during traffic spikes.
2. **High Availability**:
    - Redundant application servers prevent downtime during server failures.
3. **Enhanced Security**:
    - Firewalls restrict access to essential services.
    - HTTPS ensures encrypted communication.
4. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - Dedicated servers for specific roles improve maintainability.
#### Specifics
- **Servers**: Each server hosts a dedicated role (e.g., web, application, or database server).
- **DNS**: Configured to point to the HAProxy public IP for efficient request routing.
- **Communication Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS for user requests, private networking for internal communication.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Tracks uptime, performance, and resource usage.
#### Potential Issues
1. **Load Balancer Failure**: Mitigated with redundant HAProxy instances.
2. **Configuration Complexity**: Requires careful orchestration and maintenance.
3. **Cost**: Increased hardware and operational costs due to multiple servers.
